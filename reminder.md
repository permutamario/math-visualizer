This is just a reminder of what I was doing last

I am finishing the refactoring the API system. See the new philosohpy document to understand how this works. The parameter class and scripting language is a little ugly. We should work on this a little. 

There are still references to the deprecated Visualization class around. We need to remove these.

Make sure nothing is asking the plugin to render ( or the renderer). 

Maybe find a better name for the renderer.
